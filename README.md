## About
The AI Fact Checker is a Chrome extension that is designed to help users identify potentially misleading information on web pages. It scans the webpage content, highlights statements that may require fact-checking, and provides AI-generated insights into their credibility. The extension uses OpenAI's GPT-4 API along with Google Fact Check Tools API to analyze text and detect potential misinformation. We primarily focused on the UI so that users can identify flagged content and understand the fact-checking results. 

The extension visually highlights potentially false claims and displays explanations with confidence scores. Due to time constraints, we were unable to find an ideal fact-checking API with fully verified sources. However, we have implemented a foundation that can later be expanded with better APIs to improve accuracy. Users can manually trigger scans or enable automatic scanning for real-time analysis while browsing. With an intuitive design and straightforward functionality, this extension aims to enhance online media literacy and encourage critical thinking when consuming information.
